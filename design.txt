game idea - interstellar garden - gather plants from your environment, plant them in your settlement,
	grow them (each plant has different growth conditions of light/soil/etc)

find plants in the world where they will naturally be happy - some like shade, water, etc
machines/structures - garden bed to use a diff soil type, bucket to carry a diff type of soil back to base,
	composter to create fertilizer, rock crusher to break down soil into diff type
	how do we build these?

can unlock different planets to go to, with diff soil types, sunlight, & atmosphere conditions
	can bring seeds from prev planets but they might not do so well since they're not adapted to this environment

make it like frontierville - with bundles of certain plants you have to complete
	refined products from plants? like jam/bread/etc

how does water work? how do soil types work?
